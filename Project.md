### Project Management Case Study: Electric Vehicle Prototype
During my COMP 377: IT Project Management course, my group and I managed a semester long project management cast study. Our group studied the costs, risks, and responsibilities that a company like Toyota would need to consider when it comes to building an electric car prototype. We used a variety of project management methodologies such as scrum, risk analysis, agile management, and more.
